{H}|cFF00FF00Summary for Healers and DPS|r
During Phase One
- Constantly be on the look-out for {spell:296421}|cFFA335EEArcanado|r tornadoes and avoid getting hit by them.
- Stay away from the water at the center of the fighting area as well as at the back of it.
- Move away from other players when affected by {spell:102455}|cFFA335EEArcane Bomb|r, going to a safe, remote location to drop the void zone when healers dispel you.
During Phase Two
- Make your way to the Eye of the Storm as quickly as possible, ideally through gaps in the {spell:296462}|cFFA335EESquall Trap|r lines (if a gap does not exist, detonate a single Squall Trap to make room).
- Interrupt the Stormwraith's {spell:119358}|cFFA335EEFocus Power|r cast, and then DPS it and the Stormling adds down while remaining within the Eye of the Storm.
- Beware of the frequent knockbacks that the Stormwraith will cast through {spell:296701}|cFFA335EEGale Buffet|r.{/H}
