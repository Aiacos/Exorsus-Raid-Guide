|cFFFF00009 Queen Azshara|r
{T}|cFF00FF002.9. Summary for Tanks|r
- During Phase One
- Pick up the two mini-bosses, one tank each. Perform a tank swap when {spell:298014}|cFF72D5FFCold Blast|r reaches 3 stacks on Aethanel's tank. Interrupt Aethanel's {spell:297972}|cFF72D5FFChain Lightning|r. Move the two mini-bosses out of line of sight of each other when they are affected by {spell:297937}|cFF72D5FFPainful Memories|r and keep them in line of sight of each other when they are affected by {spell:297934}|cFF72D5FFLonging|r. During {spell:297934}|cFF72D5FFLonging|r, both mini-bosses will leave behind {spell:297907}|cFF72D5FFCursed Heart|r void zones that last until the end of the fight; keep the mini-bosses close to the edges of the room so that these void zones do not cause problems down the line.
- During Phase Two
- Perform a tank swap on Queen Azshara to handle her {spell:304475}|cFF72D5FFArcane Jolt|r ability. The boss will constantly drain Energy from the nearest Ancient Ward through {spell:303457}|cFF72D5FFTitanic Machinations|r; make sure to move her to a different Ward if the current one is getting dangerously low on Energy. If {spell:297371}|cFF72D5FFReversal of Fortune|r (Heroic-only) changes the closest Ancient Ward to a {spell:299178}|cFF72D5FFWard of Power|r, move her away from it so it does not gain Energy. When the boss's Energy bar nears 100%, move her close to a pillar or to the Titan Console, so that players can easily line of sight her when she casts {spell:300518}|cFF72D5FFArcane Detonation|r. Keep in mind the fact that ranged DPS players want to keep as far as possible from the boss before {spell:302141}|cFF72D5FFBeckon|r is being cast; keep in mind also that they may try to have the Phase One {spell:297907}|cFF72D5FFCursed Heart|r void zones between themselves and the boss.
- During Phase Three
- Perform a tank swap on Queen Azshara in the same way as during Phase Two. The off-tank should handle the Loyal Myrmidon add, making sure that it does not die. This add will have to be positioned so that the {spell:298425}|cFF72D5FFCharged Spear|r it throws at the raid goes through and breaks the Tidemistress's {spell:300620}|cFF72D5FFCrystalline Shield|r. The Ancient Wards must be handled in the same way as during Phase Two. {spell:297371}|cFF72D5FFReversal of Fortune|r appears in Normal mode as well. In Heroic mode, if {spell:297372}|cFF72D5FFGreater {spell:297371}|cFF72D5FFReversal of Fortune|r|r makes it so that there is a single Ancient Ward, the boss must be kept away from it.
- During Phase Four
- Perform a tank swap on Queen Azshara to handle the {spell:300743}|cFF72D5FFVoid Touched|r debuff she applies (swap when the off-tank's debuff has run out). Keep in mind the same {spell:303799}|cFF72D5FFBeckon|r and Ancient Ward positioning as before.{/T}{H}|cFF00FF002.10. Summary for Healers and DPS|r

Soak the {spell:298787}|cFF72D5FFArcane Orbs|r that spawn before their 20-second duration comes to and end and they explode. Manage the Ancient Wards' Energy: never let an Ancient Ward reaches 0 Energy, taking turns to stand on the Ancient Wards to power them while not letting your {spell:298569}|cFF72D5FFDrained Soul|r stacks get too high or get refreshed before they can expire.

Kill the two Tidemistresses as quickly as possible, and interrupt their {spell:297972}|cFF72D5FFChain Lightning|r.

Put the {spell:297907}|cFF72D5FFCursed Heart|r void zones from Phase One between yourselves and the boss to slow down your movement speed.
